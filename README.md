# Evidence

This repository includes simple evidence of what I worked on during the term.

---

## 1) Django (screenshots)
- **django-models.png** — VS Code view of my database models (e.g., Grade, Course, Lesson) to show ORM structure.
- **django-migrations.png** — `showmigrations` output confirming migrations applied for the apps (schema set up/updates).
- **django-login.png** — the Arabic login page of the website (Adnan Academy) used for authentication tests.

*Purpose:* demonstrate that I built a Django project with models, migrations, and authentication.

---

## 2) Social / Instagram
- **ig-grid.png** — account grid overview (recent posts layout, verified badge visible).
- **ig-post-01.png** — a final designed post after Photoshop edits.
- **psd-layers-01.png** — Photoshop workspace with layers.
- **40-posts-design.png** — a folder view showing 40 prepared post folders (batch work for scheduling).
- **I-am-the-account-manager.png** — Instagram settings page confirming I manage the account.

*Purpose:* show that I designed posts in Photoshop and managed the account content.

## 3) Workplace social-media blocking (confirmation)
- **network-block-letter.pdf** — a signed letter on **Oral Design Dental Laboratory L.L.C.** letterhead confirming that I configured their office network to block access to social media websites and applications for employees only, with access allowed for managers and owners.

*Note:* Pi-hole is installed on their pc (not my device), so I could not capture live screenshots from that environment. The company’s written confirmation is provided instead.
