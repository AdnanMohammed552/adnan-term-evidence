# Evidence of completion — Adnan

This private repository includes simple evidence of what I worked on during the term.  
I kept everything brief and easy to verify.

---

## 1) Django (screenshots)
- **django-models.png** — shows basic database models (Course, Unit, Lesson) I created to practice ORM design.
- **django-migrations.png** — list of migrations applied to set up and update the database schema.
- **django-login.png** — the login page I used for basic authentication while testing the project.

> Purpose: demonstrate that I built a small Django project with models, migrations, and authentication.

---

## 2) Social / Instagram
- **ig-grid.png** — a view of the account grid to show overall look & consistency.
- **ig-post-01.png** — a final post after edits (example of the visual style I designed).
- **psd-layers-01.png** — Photoshop screenshot with visible layers (to show real design work).
- **40-posts-design.png** — a collage/sheet of prepared post designs (batch work for scheduling).
- **i-am-the-account-manager.png** — confirmation screenshot that I manage the account.

> Purpose: show that I designed posts in Photoshop and managed the account content.

---

## 3) Workplace social-media blocking (confirmation)
- **network-block-letter.png** — a signed letter on company letterhead (Oral Design Dental Laboratory L.L.C.) confirming that I configured their office network to block social media websites and apps upon request, and that the setup is active during working hours.

> Note: Pi-hole is installed on their office machine, not on my personal device, so I cannot take live screenshots from that environment.  
> Instead, the company provided a written confirmation on letterhead. If needed, I can arrange a short live demo on site.

## Privacy
Any emails/usernames in screenshots were masked when needed. Originals can be shown in person if required.

## Quick follow-up
If the committee needs more details or a short demo, I’m available to present these items briefly.
